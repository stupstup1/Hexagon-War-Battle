did 'npm init' in this directory
did 'npm install socket.io' in this directory

to run server:
node app.js (runs app.js, which permits access to localhost:2000)

git:
git status
git add *
git add <file>
git reset
git reset <file>
git commit -m "commit text"
git push origin main
git fetch
git pull origin main (overwrite existing files with what's on github)

Debug client side:
F12 -> console -> you can type a variable and it will tell you its value.

Debug server side:
F12 -> console -> you can type eval("variable")

File communication (Express)
	Client asks server for a file
	
URL =    DOMAIN        PORT PATH
	e.g. mywebsite.com:2000/client/playerImg.png
	
Package communication (Socket.io)
	Client sends data to server
	Server sends data to client
	


Todo:
-show unit HP
-show units stats when you select them
-individual actions framework
	-moving is default action
	-attack action
- Submenu for build/spawn actions to choose building/unit.
- Still need to show appropriate radius for build/spawn actions.
-turn timer
-win/lose screen
-fix size scaling of everything
-get rid of screen flashing action icons
-handle premature disconnects by showing win screen
-Consider having player 1's information always displayed on the left and player 2's information always display on the right. Currently displayed based on turn, confusing.
-Consider adding some indicator of which player you are, confusing.
-We should set an agreed upon code style standard. Currently a mix of PascalCase, camelCase, and under_line.
-Hovering over the canvas before both players enters the game displays the grid and undefined player info. Should not do that.

Extra:
-highlighting other player's unit movement? maybe different color?
-display highlighting to player whose turn it isn't?
-pick a leader that shows up in corner of screen. Maybe has unique bonuses
-get rid of 'lobby ID' display?
-align canvas better
