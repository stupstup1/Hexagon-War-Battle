cd C:\Users\trevo\OneDrive\Desktop\online_gamer\HexagonalNodeJsGame (change working directory to appropriate location)
did 'npm init' in this directory
did 'npm install socket.io' in this directory

File communication (Express)
	Client asks server for a file

Package communication (Socket.io)
	Client sends data to server
	Server sends data to client
	


Todo:
-show unit HP
-show units stats when you select them
-individual actions framework
	-moving is default action
-food generation & spending
-turn timer
-win/lose screen
-handle premature disconnects by showing win screen

Extra:
-highlighting other player's unit movement? maybe different color?
-display highlighting to player whose turn it isn't
-pick a leader that shows up in corner of screen. Maybe has unique bonuses
-get rid of 'lobby ID' display?
-align canvas better
